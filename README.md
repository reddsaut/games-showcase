# games-showcase
This is a directory and showcase of various game projects I've worked on in undergraduate college.

## Degrowth
This project was the end result of a semester-long class called Video Games: Coding and Narrative at Macalester College. I took on the role of project manager, overseeing my two colaborators and making sure deadlines were met. I also took on a hefty amount of programming, story concepting, and level design.

## 2 Frogger 2 Furious
This Frogger clone, which has one player controlling the frog and the other spawning lines of cars, came together in the 2-day  "one button" game jam during my class Game Development: Programming and Practice at DIS: Study Abroad in Scandinavia. It was a collaboration with one classmate where I took on most of the programming tasks. Currently only runs in-editor but I plan on adding WebGL build support when I can.

## Technical Demo: City Builder Card Game
This was a 3-week project for the same class at DIS with the same collaborator. Further gameplay is planned, expanding the game into a dominion-like deckbuilder where cards let you play buildings on an iso city map, which generate resources.
